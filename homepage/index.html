        <div>My name is Abhishek and I am an Indian. I am interested in computer science to a large extent. I like playing computer games and in outdoor games catergory I am a good football player too.Computer Science has always been THE field for me â€“ I simply can't imagine spending the rest of my life in an unrelated field. I was fortunate enough to have a subject in school that introduced me to computers in general and specifically to programming languages including QBasic, C, C++ and Java. This subject (Computer Applications) had me hooked - it was gratifying to have a medium through which I could turn ideas into execution. Enrolling into a computer engineering program at college introduced me to the various facets of the subject, and showed me what a fascinatingly logical field it is.</div>
